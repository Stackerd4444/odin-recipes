    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>The Salmon</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon Filets: I used skinless salmon. Be sure you use cuts that<br/>
             are roughly the same size so they cook at the same rate.
        </li>
        <li>Olive Oil: For cooking the salmon in and also helping the seasonings stick.</li>
        <li>Dried Italian Seasoning: No Tuscan recipe is complete without this tasty blend of herbs!</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper: to give the salmon an extra layer of flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter: To give the marry me salmon sauce a tasty richness!</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic: For the perfect savory flavor. Fresh minced garlic is best!<br/>
             If you prefer a milder garlic flavor, garlic powder can also be used.
        </li>
        <li>Flour: Thickens up the sauce a little.</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth: Acts as the flavorful base of the sauce.<br/>
            You can also use mushroom or vegetable broth, but it will change the flavor slightly.
        </li>
        <li>Heavy Cream: This is what makes the sauce so good! <br/>
            You can also use half and half if you want the sauce to be a little lighter.
        </li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan: For the best nutty, cheesy flavor.</li>
        <li>Sun-Dried Tomatoes: Give the dish that classic Tuscan flavor.<br/>
             Make sure they’re drained so they don’t add too much liquid to the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Dried Italian Seasoning: More herbs to give the sauce flavor!</li>
        <li>Lemon Zest: Adds bright flavor that cuts through the richness of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil: This is optional, but if you want to add a little extra flavor to your dish,<br/>
             garnish with fresh chopped basil! It also gives the marry me salmon a perfect presentation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>The Salmon</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add Seasonings and Olive Oil: Brush olive oil on top of each of the salmon fillets using a basting brush.<br/>

            about 3 minutes on each side. Lower the heat and then allow the salmon to cook through to the center.<br/>
