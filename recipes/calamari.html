    <h2>Golden Fried Calamari</h2>
    <p>Fried Calamari is incredibly easy to make at home, and so much better than <br/>
        the restaurant! This recipe has a crispy batter that fries perfectly to a golden <br/>
        brown crunch. I share tips for ensuring the calamari isnâ€™t tough, and has great<br/> 
        flavor and robust crispiness.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb cleaned calamari tubes cut into rings,<br/> and tentacles left whole</li>
        <li>juice of 1/2 a lemon</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>marinara sauce, lemon wedges, or aioli, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Equipment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Tallow for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Prep</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the calamari into a bowl with the lemon juice,<br/> 
            and let sit for 15 minutes. This will tenderize the calamari.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the tallow or your frying oil of choice to 375 degrees F,<br/>
             either in a deep fryer or a large cast iron pot, no more than 1/2 full.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Batter</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the flour, cayenne, paprika, and salt.<br/>
             Add half of this mixture to another medium bowl. Place the buttermilk<br/> 
             or milk in a third bowl. Place the three bowls on the counter in the following<br/>
              order: spiced flour, buttermilk, and spiced flour.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the calamari from the lemon juice, then dredge each piece in the flour,<br/>
             shaking off any excess, then into the buttermilk, shaking off the excess,<br/>
              then back into the second bowl of flour. Repeat this process with all the calamari.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the calamari in batches for about 2-3 minutes total, until golden brown.<br/>
             Then drain on a paper towel and immediately salt the calamari generously so the <br/>
              salt sticks. Serve with marinara sauce and lemon wedges, if desired. Enjoy!
